# hyperspectral-sensor-shifts


This is the implementation of different methods accounting for hyperspectral sensor shifts as presented in 
- Investigating Intensity and Transversal Drift in Hyperspectral Imaging Data. Valerie Vaquet, Patrick Menz, Udo Seiffert, Barbara Hammer, ESANN 2021
- Investigating intensity and transversal drift in hyperspectral imaging data. Valerie Vaquet, Patrick Menz, Udo Seiffert, Barbara Hammer, Neurocomputing 505: 68-79 (2022)
- Robust Feature Selection and Robust Training to Cope with Hyperspectral Sensor Shifts. Valerie Vaquet, Johannes Brinkrolf, Barbara Hammer, ESANN 2023. 

Sensor shifts in hyperspectral sensor devices limit the interoperability across devices. The works investigate both robust training strategies, including a robust feature selection and appropriate preprocessing.
